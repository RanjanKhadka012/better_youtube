# better_youtube
Creating this plugin because everytime I go to Youtube, I feel that the UI is too cluttered.
The homepage with the recommendations is splattered by images, it's a visual overload.

More infuriating are the recommendations that show up when I'm watching a video. For me, these are effective baits that keep you in YT longer.

## The Homepage

2. Delete the recommendations panel when viewing a video.
